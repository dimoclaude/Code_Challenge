# Code_Challenge
This project coded in PHP, MySQL / MariaDB, and JQuery might allow one to understand how to filter and show data. By way of illustration, we have considered the case of a mini bookshop. The idea is to filter sales by customer, product, and price, and then display the results in a table just below the filter.

The project is coded POO made of three folders, namely:
  - The folder named App: Here, you will find two folders and the class Filter. Among the two folders, the one named database contains a PNG file describing the database scheme, and a SQL file including the database. The other folder contains the different classes I used for the project.
  - The folder named Model where you will find the main filter named filter.php including the other different filters. In the same folder, you will also see a JSON file named sales.json and a PHP file named data_store.php, which allows to store the JSON in the database
  - The folder named Public contains the index of the filter page and some other files included in different folders as the CSS and the JS ones.

Hope this will be useful for you. -:)
